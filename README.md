# Rust Bee

## Introduction

The topic of build scripts will never end. 
I did one for Java called [7Bee](https://github.com/drogatkin/7Bee). And I started using it for building Rust projects too.
Soon, I decided to rewrite it to Rust. Maijor disadvantage of 7Bee was using XML what made all scipts too bulky.
So major goal of Rust Bee was getting rid of XML.

## Rust Bee scripting language
The language is described [here](./doc/RUSTBEE.md)

## Bulding

It's self building tool, however it needs bootstraping. 7Bee is used for the purpose.

## Scripting examples

Some examples of using **RustBee** can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/tools6772135/rusthub/-/tree/master/src/script).
